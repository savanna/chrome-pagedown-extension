# chrome-pagedown-extension
This is a Chrome browser extension that renders a screen overlay on top of every web page.
The overlay currently provides a single button that would scroll the web page one page down.
The purpose of this is to make it reading long articles on tablets e.g. Pixelbook, Surface...,
much easier.

Save your thumb!
